# Welcome to Safe Ride

SafeRide is a unified web application designed to ensure safe, organized, and reliable school transportation for children.
With a single login, the platform supports three types of users: Parents, Drivers, and Admins, each with their own tailored features and workflows.

The app focuses on security, convenience, and transparency:

Parents can easily register their children, book rides, track ride history, and manage student profiles.

Drivers can register, upload necessary documents for approval, manage ride requests, and update their profiles.

Admins oversee the entire system by approving drivers, monitoring activity, and ensuring all operations meet safety standards.

SafeRide eliminates the hassle of multiple apps by combining all roles into one platform while maintaining a smooth and user-friendly interface.
Itâ€™s ideal for schools, transport providers, and parents looking for trustworthy school ride management.
